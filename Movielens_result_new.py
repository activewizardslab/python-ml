##### 1. Loading modules.

# In[2]:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


##### 2. Reading data.

# In[4]:

# we are using pandas "read_table" to extract data from raw files
movies=pd.read_table('movies.dat.txt',delimiter='::', header=None, names=["MovieID", "Title", "Genres"])
ratings=pd.read_table('ratings.dat.txt',delimiter='::', header=None, names=["UserID", "MovieID", "Rating", "Timestamp"])
users=pd.read_table('users.dat.txt',delimiter='::', header=None, names=["UserID", "Gender", "Age", "Occupation", "Zip-code"])


##### 3. Preparing data.

# In[5]:

#Using pandasâ€™s merge function, we first merge ratings with users then merging that result with the movies data. 
data = pd.merge(pd.merge(ratings, users), movies)
data.head(n=5)


##### 4. Call describe for some data.

# In[6]:

data[['Rating', 'Age']].describe()


# What we see:
# 
# - people, who watches movies, are less then 56 years old;
# 
# - most common age is less then 35;
# 
# - average age is about 30 years;
# 
# - average rating is more than 3.5 stars.

##### 5. Most common ratings.

# In[81]:

get_ipython().magic(u'pylab inline')
# we are using matplotlib library to plot histogram, which show most common ratings in this dataset. 
plt.hist(data.Rating, bins=10, color='blue', alpha=0.8)
plt.xlabel("Stars")


# We can see:
# 
# - people like a big part of movies and evaluate them from 3 to 5 stars.

##### 6. Find mean movie ratings for each film grouped by gender.

# In[60]:

# we are using DataFrame's pivot_table method that allow group data by column very easy. 
mean_ratings = data.pivot_table('Rating', rows='Genres', cols='Gender', aggfunc = 'mean')


# In[61]:

# we want to find the genres of movies by gender. 
# we can add a column to mean_ratings containing the difference in means, then sort by that.
mean_ratings['diff'] = mean_ratings['F'] - mean_ratings['M']
sorted_by_diff = mean_ratings.sort_index(by='diff')
sorted_by_diff[:10]


# What we see:
# 
# - top 10 genres of movies that men find better.

##### 7. Do really only women watch movies of the genre Romance?

# In[12]:

# count all genres of movies and group by gender
count_romance = data.pivot_table('Rating', rows='Genres', cols='Gender', aggfunc = 'count')


# In[40]:

m = 100 * float(num_male_romance)/float(num_male)

# We can see that the number of women who watch romances is more than double in comparison with the number of men.

# In[76]:

# find position of Romance genre
for i in range(len(mean_ratings.index)):
    if (mean_ratings.index[i].startswith("Romance")) == True:
        print i    


# In[58]:

# how women and men evaluate movies in genre Romance? The column "diff" show difference between rating each gender.  
romance_mean  = mean_ratings[290:294]
romance_mean.index = range(len(romance_mean))
print romance_mean


# In[78]:

# find mean of rating for Romance

# In[79]:

# find difference between means
diff = romance_mean.F.mean() - romance_mean.M.mean()
diff


# Women give a romance a bit higher rating than men.
# 

##### 8. Which movies do men and women most disagree on?

# In[40]:

# we have DataFrame with multi-level index,  therefore we must return new DataFrame with labeling information in the columns under the index names
data.reset_index('MovieID', inplace=True)


# In[41]:

# we want to find the movies that are most divisive between male and female.
data1 = data.pivot_table(rows=['MovieID','Title'], cols=['Gender'], values='Rating', fill_value=0)

# 'diff' gives us the movies with rating difference and which were preferred by women
data1['diff'] = data1.M - data1.F

# In[43]:

# choose top 50 movies 
most_50 = data.groupby('MovieID').size().order(ascending=False)[:50]
